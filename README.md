#Maze Runner
Authors: Maxine Hartnett and Robert Hettmansperger

A mouse runs through a randomly generated maze using a brute force method of stacks. The code will crash with an error message of "YOU WON" when the mouse finds the cheese.

TO RUN: Download the file and run the "Runner.java" code. I've experienced a few problems with the icons while downloading.

This program uses custom Stack and Linked List classes, both developed by me. You can find the code for these classes in CS2Stack.java and CS2LinkedList.java.
